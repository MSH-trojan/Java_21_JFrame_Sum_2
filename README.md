# Java_21_JFrame_Sum_2

## Overview of the Program:

1 - as always starting with the importing of 3 libraries of events and swing, etc.

2 - defining our Jcomponents at the start.

3 - defining a gridLayout and then positioning different JComponents based on the Layout's size and dimentions.

4 - using an implementation of ActionListener is a good idea to remove the process of making a named or no-named class 
for ActionListening and also making ActionHandler values,etc.

5 - lastly, the result when button is clicked will be programmed on the *actionPerformed* part (getting the text from two grid cells and setting the text as sum in another cell when the button is clicked).
